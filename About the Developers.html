    <p><span  style="font-weight: bold;">Bily</span>: Being introduced to video
      games at such a young age of around 6 has led me to develop a strong
      passion and liking towards video games after finding strong interest in
      games, I continue to grow them over the course of my life. The first games
      ever introduced to me were simple games such as the windows-default
      minesweeper and pinball. Soon enough, I found myself playing with a wide
      variety of games throughout the years and it never stops to amaze me how
      wonderful some of the experiences and enjoyments I have had with so many
      different games. Eventually i found myself to like a few strict variety of
      genres such as Sid Meier's Civilization 3-5 genre of turn-based strategy,
      Age of Empires 2 genre of real-time strategy and Borderlands 2 genre of
      RPG+FPS. </p>
    <p>I look forward to any more games of my favorite genre that will be made
      in the future! Like Civilization 6! If it ever comes that is.</p>
